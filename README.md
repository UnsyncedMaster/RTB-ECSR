## 🛠️ Installation

## 🚀 How It Works

This script pulls item RAP and value data and injects it into key UI elements across the ECSR site. Trade interfaces are enhanced with real-time calculations showing the total value of each side and the difference — so you always know if a trade is a win or loss.
